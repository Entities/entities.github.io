# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: My name is Shany Grosman, and I am a .NET software developer with a B.S. in Architecture (the kind you live in). I build solutions for various web platforms and backend applications, construct design schematics for sustainable architecture technologies, and can also chew bubble gum at the same time. My specialty is in code optimization, API integrations, and development of data-driven toolsets. I have always pursued my passion for building the infrastructure that drive our daily experiences, and love discovering and refining the needs of my clients.
