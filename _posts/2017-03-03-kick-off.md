title: Installment 01 - Kick-Off!

In this post we provide strong evidence that autoencoders have very poor creative power. We develop multiple models, starting from a standard convolutional autoencoder up to a very sofisticated deep ResNet and run experiments that shattered our hopes of ever generating somewhat "life-like" images let alone analysing the effect of captions. While this introduction might, at first sight, seem hugely pessimistic we we're able to gather important intelligence that will help us throughout this project, we also pinpoint the main flaw in our model and propose an alternative that we will explore in the following posts.
